% Create a new section.
\section{Introduction}
Hello World! This is a test! I want to see if this text will wrap at all. If it does this is good news.

% Create a new section.
\section{How to create a bulleted list}
This is the Second Section. Let's also see if this text wraps. Will this be below or beside Introduction? Here is how to create a list:

% Create a list.
\begin{itemize}
\item First bullet point
\item This is the second bullet point.
\item And so on...
\end{itemize}

Then we can carry on the section. But we must be careful because the beginning of this line will be indented as it is after a list.

% End the column and start a new one.
\columnbreak

% Create a new section.
\section{New Section}
This is a new Section. This one should wrap too. This is the third section.

% End the two column formatting.
\end{multicols}

% End the document.
\end{document}
